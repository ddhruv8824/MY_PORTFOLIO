          Hi, I'm Dhruv Suthar, a passionate full-stack developer with expertise
          in building user-friendly and responsive web applications. I work with
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js,
          Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS to deliver innovative and efficient
          solutions for complex web development challenges. With a strong focus
          on clean, maintainable code and seamless user experiences, I thrive in
          crafting both robust backends and visually stunning frontends.
          Bringing ideas to life through technology is what drives me, and Iâ€™m
          committed to making an impact by delivering scalable and high-quality
          solutions.
